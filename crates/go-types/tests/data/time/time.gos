package time

type Time struct {
	// wall and ext encode the wall time seconds, wall time nanoseconds,
	// and optional monotonic clock reading in nanoseconds.
	//
	// From high to low bit position, wall encodes a 1-bit flag (hasMonotonic),
	// a 33-bit seconds field, and a 30-bit wall time nanoseconds field.
	// The nanoseconds field is in the range [0, 999999999].
	// If the hasMonotonic bit is 0, then the 33-bit field must be zero
	// and the full signed 64-bit wall seconds since Jan 1 year 1 is stored in ext.
	// If the hasMonotonic bit is 1, then the 33-bit field holds a 33-bit
	// unsigned wall seconds since Jan 1 year 1885, and ext holds a
	// signed 64-bit monotonic clock reading, nanoseconds since process start.
	wall uint64
	ext  int64

	// loc specifies the Location that should be used to
	// determine the minute, hour, month, day, and year
	// that correspond to this Time.
	// The nil location means UTC.
	// All UTC times are represented with loc==nil, never loc==&utcLoc.
	loc *Time
