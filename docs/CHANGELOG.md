# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Fix plugin parameter passing system
- Implement real coverage analysis (remove mock data)
- Add JSON and text output formatters
- Web-based visualization dashboard
- IDE integration plugins

## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-XX

### Added
- **Plugin-based architecture** with ABI stability using `abi_stable` crate
- **Control Flow Graph (CFG) generation** with DOT format output
- **Branch coverage analysis** framework (currently with mock data)
- **Statement coverage analysis** framework (currently with mock data)
- **Cyclomatic complexity analysis** with basic implementation
- **Command-line interface** with multiple analysis subcommands
- **Dynamic plugin loading** system with dependency resolution
- **Go AST parsing** and manipulation capabilities
- **Comprehensive test suite** including integration tests
- **Documentation** including architecture guide and plugin development guide

### Core Features
- `cfg` command - Generate Control Flow Graphs for Go functions
- `branch-cov` command - Analyze branch coverage (framework ready)
- `statement-cov` command - Analyze statement coverage (framework ready)
- `complexity` command - Calculate cyclomatic complexity
- `all` command - Run all available analyses
- `list` command - Show available plugins and analyses

### Technical Implementation
- **Plugin Manager** - Dynamic loading and execution orchestration
- **ABI-Stable Interfaces** - Cross-version plugin compatibility
- **Topological Sorting** - Automatic plugin dependency resolution
- **Error Handling** - Robust error propagation and user feedback
- **Multiple Output Formats** - DOT visualization format (JSON/text planned)

### Plugins Implemented
- **cfg_plugin** - Control Flow Graph generation and DOT export
- **branch_cov_plugin** - Branch coverage analysis framework
- **statement_cov_plugin** - Statement coverage analysis framework
- **cyclomatic_complexity_plugin** - Code complexity metrics
- **plugin1/plugin2** - Example plugins for development reference

### Build System
- **Cargo workspace** - Modular build system with multiple crates
- **CI/CD pipeline** - GitHub Actions for automated testing
- **Plugin build script** - Automated plugin compilation
- **Cross-platform support** - macOS, Linux, Windows (shared libraries)

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
- Architecture documentation explaining plugin system design
- Plugin development guide with examples
- Contributing guidelines for developers
- Project handover documentation for team transitions

### Testing
- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests with real Go projects
- Plugin-specific test suites
- ABI compatibility verification tests
- CLI functionality tests

### Known Issues
- Parameter passing between plugins uses hardcoded values (ABI workaround)
- Coverage plugins return mock data (real implementation needed)
- JSON/text output formatters partially implemented
- Advanced Go language features have limited support

### Breaking Changes
- N/A (initial release)

### Security
- Memory-safe implementation using Rust
- No known security vulnerabilities
- Plugin sandboxing not implemented (future consideration)

### Performance
- Efficient for small to medium Go projects (<1000 files)
- Memory usage typically <100MB
- Analysis time scales linearly with project size
- Parallel plugin execution not yet implemented

### Dependencies
- Rust 1.70.0 or later
- Go 1.19 or later (for analyzing Go projects)
- Platform-specific shared library support
