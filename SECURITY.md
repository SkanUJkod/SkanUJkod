## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in SkanUJkod, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email us directly** at [security@skanujkod.example.com]
3. **Include the following information**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We'll provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
- **Regular Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical issues within 7 days

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- We'll work with you to understand the issue
- We'll develop and test a fix
- We'll coordinate the disclosure timeline
- We'll credit you in our security advisory (if desired)

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Status

#### ✅ Secure by Design
- **Memory Safety**: Written in Rust with compile-time memory safety guarantees
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents many classes of vulnerabilities
- **No Buffer Overflows**: Rust's ownership system prevents buffer overflows
- **No Use-After-Free**: Compile-time prevention of memory management errors

#### ⚠️ Areas of Concern
- **Plugin Loading**: Dynamic library loading could be exploited with malicious plugins
- **File System Access**: Direct file system access for reading Go projects
- **No Sandboxing**: Plugins run with full system privileges
- **Input Validation**: Limited validation of Go source code inputs

### Security Best Practices

#### For Users
1. **Plugin Sources**: Only use plugins from trusted sources
2. **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file permissions on plugin directories
3. **Network Isolation**: Run in isolated environments for untrusted code analysis
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep SkanUJkod updated to latest security patches

#### For Developers
1. **Code Review**: All plugin code should be reviewed before deployment
2. **Input Sanitization**: Validate all inputs, especially file paths
3. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
4. **Dependency Management**: Regularly audit and update dependencies

### Known Security Limitations

#### Plugin Security
- **No Sandboxing**: Plugins have full system access
- **Arbitrary Code Execution**: Malicious plugins can execute arbitrary code
- **File System Access**: Plugins can read/write any accessible files
- **Network Access**: Plugins can make network connections

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Use trusted plugin sources only
- Review plugin source code before installation
- Run in containerized environments for untrusted analysis
- Implement file system permissions and access controls

#### Go Code Analysis
- **Code Injection**: Malicious Go code could exploit parser vulnerabilities
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Large/complex projects could cause denial of service
- **Path Traversal**: Malicious projects could attempt path traversal attacks

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Validate project paths and prevent path traversal
- Implement resource limits (memory, time)
- Run analysis in isolated environments
- Sanitize file paths and names

## Security Architecture

### Trust Boundaries

```
User Input → CLI → Plugin Manager → Plugins → File System
    ↓         ↓         ↓            ↓         ↓
  Limited   Limited   Trusted     Untrusted  Trusted
```

1. **User Input**: Limited trust - validate all inputs
2. **CLI Layer**: Limited trust - sanitize arguments
3. **Plugin Manager**: Trusted - core application code
4. **Plugins**: Untrusted - could be malicious
5. **File System**: Trusted - but accessible to plugins

### Security Controls

#### Input Validation
- Path traversal prevention
- File extension validation
- Project structure validation
- Parameter sanitization

#### Plugin Management
- Plugin signature verification (planned)
- Plugin permission system (planned)
- Resource limits (planned)
- Audit logging (planned)

#### Error Handling
- No sensitive information in error messages
- Consistent error responses
- Proper logging without leaking data

## Vulnerability Categories

### High Severity
- **Remote Code Execution**: Through malicious plugins or Go code
- **Privilege Escalation**: Via plugin vulnerabilities
- **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive data exposure

### Medium Severity
- **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion attacks
- **Path Traversal**: Unauthorized file access
- **Plugin Tampering**: Malicious plugin modification

### Low Severity
- **Information Leakage**: Non-sensitive data exposure
- **Configuration Issues**: Insecure default settings

## Security Roadmap

### Short Term (Next Release)
- [ ] Input validation improvements
- [ ] Plugin source verification
- [ ] Resource limit implementation
- [ ] Security audit of dependencies

### Medium Term (Next 6 Months)
- [ ] Plugin sandboxing system
- [ ] Permission-based plugin access
- [ ] Security-focused documentation
- [ ] Automated security testing

### Long Term (Next Year)
- [ ] Plugin signature verification
- [ ] Security audit by third party
- [ ] Formal security model documentation
- [ ] Security certification

## Dependencies Security

### Rust Dependencies
We regularly audit our Rust dependencies for vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Install cargo-audit
cargo install cargo-audit

# Run security audit
cargo audit
```

### Go Dependencies
While we don't include Go dependencies, we parse Go code which could contain vulnerabilities.

### Security Monitoring
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **Cargo Audit**: Regular vulnerability scanning
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Monitor for new vulnerabilities

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

#### Critical (P0)
- Remote code execution
- Data breach
- System compromise
- **Response Time**: Immediate (within 1 hour)

#### High (P1)
- Privilege escalation
- Denial of service
- Data exposure
- **Response Time**: Within 4 hours

#### Medium (P2)
