<!-- This section should be prefaced with a quick explanation of why Rust was chosen as the language to implement the framework in. No networking or otherwise remote calls are required from a static analysis framework, and since it is offline, it works mostly like any other OS CLI utility tool. These are fashionable to implement in Rust, as seen by many efforts to, for example, port coreutils implementations from C to Rust, with very impressive tools like [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/tree/master) born out of it. -->
